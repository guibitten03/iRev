# Review-Aware Recommender Framework

This repository contains a framework for creating review-aware recommender systems. The framework provides configurable modules to build recommendation algorithms that leverage user review data to enhance recommendations.

## Repository Structure

- **Algorithm Configurations**: Defines configurations and hyperparameters for the recommendation models. In this module, you can fine-tune aspects such as learning rate, number of epochs, and model-specific parameters.

- **Preprocessing and Dataset Preparation**: Contains scripts and functions to process the input data. This includes cleaning, tokenization, feature extraction, and any preprocessing required to handle textual and structured data.

- **Models**: Implements recommendation models using user review data. This module includes deep learning-based approaches, supervised learning, and hybrid methods.

- **Metrics**: Provides evaluation metrics to measure the quality of recommendations. This module includes standard metrics like RMSE, MAE, and precision/top-N, as well as text-specific metrics.

- **Results Module**: Centralizes the analysis of the results generated by the models. Allows saving and visualizing graphs, tables, and detailed performance reports for different model configurations.
