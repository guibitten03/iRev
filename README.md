# Review-Aware Recommender Framework

The iRev contains a framework for creating review-aware recommender systems. The framework provides configurable modules to build recommendation algorithms that leverage user review data to enhance recommendations.

## Repository Structure

- **Algorithm Configurations**: Defines configurations and hyperparameters for the recommendation models. In this module, you can fine-tune aspects such as learning rate, number of epochs, and model-specific parameters.

- **Preprocessing and Dataset Preparation**: Contains scripts and functions to process the input data. This includes cleaning, tokenization, feature extraction, and any preprocessing required to handle textual and structured data.

- **Models**: Implements recommendation models using user review data. This module includes deep learning-based approaches, supervised learning, and hybrid methods.

- **Metrics**: Provides evaluation metrics to measure the quality of recommendations. This module includes standard metrics like RMSE, MAE, and precision/top-N, as well as text-specific metrics.

- **Results Module**: Centralizes the analysis of the results generated by the models. Allows saving and visualizing graphs, tables, and detailed performance reports for different model configurations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git

# Review Aware Recommender Systems Taxonomy:

Our analyses identified three distinct categories represented in Figure 3, consisting of:  
(1) **Document Modeling**: works that concatenate all user comments, including on items, into a single document;  
(2) **Sentence Modeling**: works that propose mechanisms for recognizing key words in sentences and, subsequently, key sentences, to compose the representation of users and items; and  
(3) **Rating Aggregation**: works that seek to associate the numerical evaluations of users/items with their respective comments, similar to traditional recommendation systems that rely on collaborative filtering.
